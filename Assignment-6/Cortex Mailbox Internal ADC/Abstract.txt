This example program shows how to use the RTX Kernel mailboxes
for task inter-communication. Because the message objects in this
example are fixed size, the RTX Thread-Safe Fixed-Block Memory
Allocation functions are used. They are fully reentrant and can
be used with RTX Kernel with no restrictions.

Internal ADC converted values are stored in Mailbox in task1 & Those
stored Values are displayed in task2. output can be seen on hyper 
terminal.
